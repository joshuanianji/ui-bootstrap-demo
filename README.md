# Elm Ui Bootstrap Demo App

This small application is created to demonstrate [elm-ui-bootstrap](https://github.com/jiwhiz/elm-ui-bootstrap), a WIP package that aims to rewrite Bootstrap with Elm Ui.


See the running app on my [website](https://joshuaji.com/projects/ui-bootstrap-demo/)


## Run Locally

Since [elm-ui-bootstrap](https://github.com/jiwhiz/elm-ui-bootstrap) is not released yet, you need to check out source code of it with this repo as well:

`git clone https://github.com/jiwhiz/elm-ui-bootstrap`


Make sure npm, elm and create-elm-app are installed, and run the following command in the root directory:

`elm-app start`
